# Diabetes Prediction using ANN 🧠⚕️

This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health data. The model is built using **TensorFlow/Keras**, with preprocessing techniques like scaling, dropout, batch normalization, and early stopping to ensure robust performance.
